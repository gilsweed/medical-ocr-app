# Chat Notes - March 14, 2024

## How to Update This File

### To Save New Chat Content
1. Say: "Please save our current chat to docs/chat_notes.md"
2. I will:
   - Create a new section with today's date
   - Add the new content with proper formatting
   - Preserve all previous content

### To Update Existing Content
1. Say: "Please update docs/chat_notes.md with [specific changes]"
2. I will:
   - Make the requested changes
   - Keep the formatting consistent
   - Preserve other content

## File Preview System Discussion

### Current Implementation
- Files are displayed in two columns side by side
- Left column shows file previews
- Right column shows OCR text
- Files are sorted by confidence level (low, high, other)

### Page Navigation
- Each file can have multiple pages
- Navigation using < and > buttons
- Page counter shows current position
- Preview and OCR text update together

### File Organization
- Files sorted by confidence:
  * Low confidence files first
  * High confidence files second
  * Other files last

### Rotation Feature
- Each preview has a rotate button (‚ü≥)
- 90-degree rotation increments
- Only affects preview, not OCR text

## Three-Column Layout Discussion

### Column Structure
1. **Left Column (File Previews)**
   - Shows file previews stacked vertically
   - Each preview has:
     * File name and page info
     * Preview content area
     * Page navigation controls
   - Minimum width: 100px (changed from 180px)

2. **Middle Column (OCR Text)**
   - Shows OCR text for each file
   - Synchronized with file previews
   - Each OCR block has:
     * File name and page info
     * OCR text content
   - Minimum width: 100px (changed from 300px)

3. **Right Column (Summary Panel)**
   - Shows document summaries
   - Right-aligned Hebrew text
   - Minimum width: 100px (changed from 350px)

### Divider Behavior
- **Left Divider**
  * Controls space between preview and OCR columns
  * Moving right makes preview column bigger
  * Moving left makes preview column smaller
  * Does not affect right divider or summary panel

- **Right Divider**
  * Controls space between OCR and summary columns
  * Right edge of summary panel stays fixed to screen edge
  * Only left edge of summary panel moves with divider
  * Does not affect left divider or preview column

### Important Notes
- Dividers operate independently
- No cross-divider interference
- Each divider only affects its adjacent columns
- Summary panel's right edge stays fixed to screen
- These behaviors will be maintained in all future iterations 

# Chat Notes - Git Repository Cleanup and Backup

## Context
The user was working on an Electron application with Google Vision API and PDF viewing capabilities. They encountered issues with pushing changes to GitHub due to large files exceeding the size limit (specifically a file related to the Electron framework that was 142.96 MB).

## Solution Implemented
The user successfully cleaned the repository using the following steps:

1. Created a new orphan branch:
```bash
git checkout --orphan temp_branch
```

2. Added current files:
```bash
git add .
```

3. Committed the files:
```bash
git commit -m "Fresh start without large files"
```

4. Deleted the old main branch:
```bash
git branch -D main
```

5. Renamed the new branch to main:
```bash
git branch -m main
```

6. Force pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git push -f origin main
```

The operation was successful with:
- 289 objects enumerated
- 231 objects compressed
- 25.18 MiB of data transferred
- 64 deltas resolved

## Git Backup Instructions Template
A comprehensive template was created for future git backups, including:
- Preface and current state information
- Backup details and exclusions
- Remote repository information
- Special considerations for large files
- Backup strategy
- Post-backup verification steps
- Execution steps with conditional logic for handling large files

## Git Restore Instructions Template
A template was also created for restoring this version, including:
- Preface and current state information
- Restore details
- Special considerations
- Execution steps
- Post-restore verification

## Key Learnings
1. Using `git checkout --orphan` is an effective way to create a clean repository history
2. Force pushing (`git push -f`) is necessary when cleaning repository history
3. It's important to verify the repository state after major operations
4. Having templates for backup and restore operations helps maintain consistency

## Next Steps
1. Continue development with the clean repository
2. Use the backup template for future commits
3. Keep the restore template for future reference
4. Monitor for any new large files that might need to be excluded
