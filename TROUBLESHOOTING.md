# TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE: Electron App (May 2025)

## Project Directory
`/Users/gilsweed/Desktop/Brurya/gil`

## Key Files
- `electron.js` (main Electron entry file)
- `index.html` (main UI file)
- `package.json` (with `"main": "electron.js"`)

## What Was Done
- Confirmed the correct project directory and entry files.
- Used git to commit and backup all changes.
- Troubleshot why changes to `electron.js` were not appearing when running `npm start`.
- Ensured all commands were run from the correct directory.
- Used debug lines at the top of `electron.js` to confirm which file was being used.
- Verified that git is not automatically overwriting files.
- All steps, commands, and results are documented in the May 2025 troubleshooting chat.

## Current Mission
- Make sure changes to `electron.js` are reflected when running `npm start`.
- Confirm by adding a debug line at the top of `electron.js` and seeing it in the terminal output.

## Backup
- All changes are committed in git.
- You can always restore your state with:
  ```sh
  git checkout electron.js index.html
  ```

## How to Use This Guide
- If you open a new chat or need help in the future, reference this file and paste its contents into the chat.
- Mention your project directory and the current issue.
- Ask for help with a specific next step or troubleshooting.

## How to Confirm You Are Editing the Correct electron.js File

If you are not sure your changes to electron.js are being used, do this:

1. Open electron.js in your project folder:
   ```sh
   nano /Users/gilsweed/Desktop/Brurya/gil/electron.js
   ```
2. At the very top, add this line:
   ```js
   console.log('*** DEBUG: electron.js running from', __dirname);
   ```
3. Save and exit nano (Ctrl + O, Enter, then Ctrl + X).
4. Start your app:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
5. Look for this line in your terminal:
   ```
   *** DEBUG: electron.js running from /Users/gilsweed/Desktop/Brurya/gil
   ```
6. If you see it, you are editing the correct file. If not, check your folder and try again.

This step ensures you are working on the right file and your changes will take effect.
