  - x86_64 (Intel Macs)
  - arm64 (Apple Silicon/M1/M2/M3)
- **System Requirements:**
  - macOS 10.15.x Catalina, 11.x Big Sur (should work on newer Apple Silicon)
  - 1GB+ RAM, 2GB+ disk space, 15MB per page for multi-page docs
- **Installation Steps:**
  1. Download the correct .dmg for your architecture (arm64 for M2).
  2. Mount the .dmg and copy:
     - `FREngine.framework` (required)
     - `Samples` (optional, recommended)
     - `Help` (optional)
     - `activateFREngine.command` (required)
  3. Run `activateFREngine.command` to activate your license (offline via email).
  4. For macOS Catalina, run the first call from a GUI session as the current user.

## 4. Release Notes Highlights (Release 5, Build 12.5.12.26025)
- **New 'Accurate' recognition mode** for best quality on poor scans/medical docs
- **Improved table and PDF processing** (mixed content, digital signatures, portfolios)
- **Machine learning barcode recognition**
- **NeoML integration** for advanced ML tasks
- **Embedded PDFium** for native PDF handling
- **Expanded API:** new methods for digital signatures, PDF portfolios, text layer quality
- **Export improvements:** PowerPoint, XLS, XPS
- **License management:** grace periods, volume refreshing
- **Deprecated:** old FastMode/BalancedMode, some CLI keys

## 5. Integration Plan (Next Steps)
- **Phase 1:** Download, install, and activate SDK (arm64 build for M2)
- **Phase 2:** Run CLI sample for batch OCR (test with Hebrew/mixed docs)
- **Phase 3:** Integrate CLI calls into backend (Node.js/Python)
- **Phase 4:** Replace Google Vision with ABBYY in app workflow
- **Phase 5:** Test, document, and ensure compliance

## 7. Side-by-Side Comparison: ABBYY vs. Google Vision

It is safe to run a side-by-side comparison of ABBYY FineReader Engine and Google Vision OCR, as long as integrations are kept separate and resources are managed properly.

**Best Practices for Side-by-Side Comparison:**
- Keep ABBYY and Google Vision code paths separate in your backend.
- For each document, call both OCR engines independently (sequentially or in parallel).
- Store results from each engine separately (e.g., `abbyy_result.txt` and `google_result.txt`).
- Clean up any temporary files created by either engine.
- Monitor memory and CPU usage if running both engines on large batches.
- Only use Google Vision on non-sensitive test documents if privacy is a concern (since it sends data to the cloud).

**Summary Table:**
| Approach         | Conflict Risk | Notes                                      |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ABBYY only       | None         | Fully local, secure                        |
| Google only      | None         | Cloud-based, less private                  |
| Side-by-side     | Low          | Safe if code is separate and files managed |

**Note:**
Running both engines side-by-side will not cause conflicts as long as you:
- Clearly label and separate the results from each engine
- Use a config flag or UI toggle to control which engine(s) to use for each test
- Manage file access and cleanup properly

This approach allows you to compare accuracy, speed, and reliability before fully switching to ABBYY.
